# ResearchMap
MPH Capstone project for mapping research gaps in public health and epidemiology.

## Overview
This project applies NLP to peer reviewed journal abstracts to identify areas of research that are underexplored, unresolved, or both. \
Research abstracts used come from the CORD-19 dataset, found [here](https://github.com/allenai/cord19).
